name: create-pr
description: Push the current branch and create a pull request on tikv/pd following the repository's PR template. Analyzes commits, generates PR title/body from changes, and submits via `gh pr create`. Use when you have local commits ready to submit as a PR.
compatibility: Requires gh CLI authenticated with tikv/pd repo access. Must have local commits on a non-master branch.

# Persona & Goal

PD contributor assistant. Push the current branch and open a well-formatted pull request on tikv/pd, auto-filling every section of the PR template based on the actual changes.

# Reference Files

| File | Contents | Load When |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/pull_request_template.md` | The exact PR template structure | **Phase 2** — when composing the PR body |
| [references/pr-template.md](references/pr-template.md) | Additional filling guidelines for the PR template | **Phase 2** — when composing the PR body |

# Workflow

## Phase 1: Gather Context

Collect all information needed to fill the PR template. Run these in parallel:

1. `git status` — confirm working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes).
2. `git branch --show-current` — get current branch name.
3. `git log --oneline master..HEAD` — list all commits being submitted.
4. `git diff master...HEAD --stat` — summary of changed files.
5. `git diff master...HEAD` — full diff for analysis.

**Gate**: If working tree is dirty, ask the user whether to commit first or proceed with committed changes only. If on `master`, stop and ask the user to create a branch.

## Phase 2: Compose PR Content

> **Load `.github/pull_request_template.md` and [references/pr-template.md](references/pr-template.md) now.**

### PR Title

Follow the PD convention: `pkg [, pkg2]: short description`

- Derive package names from the changed file paths (e.g., `server/`, `pkg/schedule/` → `server, schedule`).
- Use `*:` if changes span many packages.
- Keep title under 70 characters.

### PR Body

Fill every section of the PR template:

1. **What problem does this PR solve?**
   - If the user provides issue numbers, ask whether each should be `close` or `ref`, then write the appropriate `Issue Number: close #xxx` or `Issue Number: ref #xxx` line.
   - If issue numbers are unknown, ask the user first. Do not invent placeholders.
   - Summarize the problem being solved based on commit messages and diff analysis.

2. **What is changed and how does it work?**
   - Describe the implementation approach.
   - Fill the `commit-message` code block with a concise summary suitable for the squash-merge commit.

3. **Check List**
   - **Tests**: Infer from the diff which test types apply (unit test if `_test.go` files changed, etc.).
   - **Code changes**: Check if configuration, HTTP API, or persistent data changed.
   - **Side effects**: Assess performance regression, complexity, and backward compatibility.
   - **Related changes**: Leave blank unless obvious from context.
   - **Omit empty subsections**: If Code changes, Side effects, or Related changes have no items, remove their heading entirely from the PR body.

4. **Release note**
   - If the change is a bug fix or new feature, write a user-facing release note.
   - Otherwise keep `None.` in the release-note block.

### Present to User

Show the composed PR title and full body to the user for review **before** creating the PR. Ask if any section needs adjustment (especially the issue number).

## Phase 3: Push and Create PR

After user approval:

1. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

2. Create the PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --repo tikv/pd --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
   ```
   Use a HEREDOC for the body to preserve formatting.

3. Report the PR URL back to the user.

## Phase 4: Post-Creation

If the push or PR creation fails:

- **Push rejected**: Check if the remote branch exists; suggest force-push only if user confirms.
- **PR already exists**: Show the existing PR URL; offer to update it instead.
- **Auth failure**: Remind user to authenticate with `gh auth login`.

# Agent Constraints

- **Never force-push without user confirmation.**
- **Always show the PR content before submitting.** User must approve title and body.
- **Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations.** Do not guess API URLs.
- **Follow PD commit conventions.** `pkg: message` format for title.
- **Do not modify code.** This skill only pushes and creates PRs.
- **Ask for issue number if unknown.** Do not invent issue references.
